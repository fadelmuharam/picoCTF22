### SOLVING
* We have to start an instance, to launch the site. From the challenge name we can see SQL"`i`"Lite, where the letter i indicates us that this could be sql injection.
* Let’s login using random credentials and see what the webpage returns. In this case, I'm using username=admin and password=admin

* Now we know the query used to return the data from table.
* We have to use SQL injection payloads to exploit this.
* I'm using common SQLi payloads.
> ' or 1=1 --
* The “ — “ means we comment the remaining query command and “or 1=1” sets as logical condition to pass the query.
