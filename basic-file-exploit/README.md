## Description

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat :

`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52681`

After download file from the link, we get the source code of the program with the flag redacted.
To get the flag, we need to understand the program's logic and exploit it.

>_"in line 143-147 from the program's source code, we know that the flag will be printed if we enter entry equal to zero"_

SOLVING :
* Netcat into the service $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52681
* Use option 1 to add a new entry
* After adding the new entry, read the file from the "database" using option 2
* At this point it will ask for the entry number of the data. Type zero, press enter and get the flag.
